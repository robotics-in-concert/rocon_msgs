# Some commonly used constant strings in the concert.
#
# Note: avoid using hardcoded topic_name strings here. Prefer rostopic.find_by_type
# and rosservice.rosservice_find for getting services that should be unique
# (e.g. gateway/interactions). Refer to rocon_python_comms for some wrappers around these.
