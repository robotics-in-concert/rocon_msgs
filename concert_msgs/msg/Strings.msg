# Strings that are constant with respect to the entire concert. Listing them here
# allows every user to automatically update if there are any refactorings.
#
# Note: personally every fibre of my existential ros experience strums with
# the twang of rebellion at the thought of hardcoding strings. We have however
# quite alot of places where remappings are impossible (android remocons, ...)
# and launcher remappings are sometimes done in code anyway (especially where we are
# using the roslaunch api such as in the service manager). Having them centralised
# here makes refactoring across the whole concert as easy as possible.
#
# Note: nonetheless, use these directly as little as possible.
